Data Retrieval Task 3
As part of the Library Management System project, this task focused on practicing and demonstrating various SQL commands for retrieving and organizing data from the database.

Task Objectives
Using SELECT * and specific columns
Learned how to retrieve complete rows using SELECT *, as well as how to fetch only specific columns when detailed output is needed. 
This improves efficiency and clarity when working with large datasets.

Applying WHERE, AND, OR, LIKE, and BETWEEN
Explored different ways to filter records based on conditions. Used:

WHERE to apply basic filters

AND and OR to combine multiple conditions

LIKE for partial text matching

BETWEEN to filter values within a specific range (like dates or numbers)

These filtering techniques help extract only the relevant data from the database.

Sorting with ORDER BY
Practiced how to sort query results either in ascending or descending order. Sorting makes the output more readable and meaningful, especially when working with reports or dashboards.
